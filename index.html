<h1>Welcome to Michael Tarantino's Portfolio</h1>
<p>
	I'm currently adding projects to this page little by little.
	<br>Formatting and general beautification will be added eventually as well.
	<br>Each link on this page should lead you to a demo/small game.

	<a href="taramic42.github.io/testpage">Down to 1</a>
	<br>Description:
	<br>A rather simple math game. You are given a large random number. 
	<br>Do your best to get that number down to 1 as quickly as possible.
	<br>Larger operations yield more points. Do them if you can.
	<br>Every second divides your score.
	<br>But remember, one mistake and it's all over.
